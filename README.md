# Warning
This app probably will not be maintained and the logic is heavily dependent on wordreference.com's website structure. It might break in the future. It's only a small project written for my personal use.

# Usage

conjugator.exe executable is contained in "Application" folder

Input Mode ('i'):
 - simply type in a word to conjugate

File Mode ('f'):
 - this mode will automatically open a file explorer, a valid *.txt file must be choosen
 - valid *.txt file looks like ("{}" signify start of file and end of file):
{word_1
word_2
word_3
.
.
.
word_n}

each line in a txt file will be interpreted as a separate word

!! Beware that long files (50+ words), might take a minute to complete, output will appear only after it's entirely done !!
