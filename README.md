# Spanish-verb-conjugator
Program that uses wordreference.com web scraping to conjugate spanish verbs

## Warning
This app probably will not be maintained and the logic is heavily dependent on wordreference.com's website structure, also it is not well-written. It might break in the future. It's only a small project written for my personal use.

## Usage
Input Mode ('i'):
 - type in a word to conjugate and click enter

File Mode ('f'):
 - this mode will automatically open a file explorer, a valid .txt file with the word list must be choosen
 - in a valid .txt file every word should be in a separate line. "example_list.txt" in a root is a valid file

each line in a txt file will be interpreted as a separate word

!! Beware that long files (50+ words), might take a minute to complete, output will appear only after it's entirely done !!
